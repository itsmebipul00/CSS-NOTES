pixels - print css
relative
perrcent - wrt parent, widths
wrt vp- vmin, vmax, 
wrt font szies- em(parent container), rem(root html)

margins
can collapse anytime they touch each other
if first child in an element has margin top, that can merge with parents margin top
out here we can add padding on the parent to prevent parents margin from merging with the childs
you can only nest other inline elements inside inline elements
inline elements will only respect margin and padding placed on left and right

styling links
links have different states that we can style:
*default link state => a:link
*hover => a:hover
*visited => a:focus
*hover => a:hover
*active => a:active

shorthand propertities goes clockwise: top right bottom left

sometimes we need something which is inline but we can set the margin and padding, so here we can use display:inline-block
