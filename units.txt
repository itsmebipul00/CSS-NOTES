pixels - print css
relative
perrcent - wrt parent, widths
wrt vp- vmin, vmax, 
wrt font szies- em(parent container), rem(root html)

margins
can collapse anytime they touch each other
if first child in an element has margin top, that can merge with parents margin top
out here we can add padding on the parent to prevent parents margin from merging with the childs
you can only nest other inline elements inside inline elements
inline elements will only respect margin and padding placed on left and right

styling links
links have different states that we can style:
*default link state => a:link
*hover => a:hover
*visited => a:focus
*hover => a:hover
*active => a:active

shorthand propertities goes clockwise: top right bottom left

sometimes we need something which is inline but we can set the margin and padding, so here we can use display:inline-block

while styling buttons put class directly on the link and always use padding to create the size of the button not width and height
padding on left and right generally need to be larger than the top and the bottom(1:2 ratio generally)

The more specific the selectors are higher the priority, from lowest to highest:
i. element selector, class selector and id selector

approaching specificity:
general rules put on the element selectors eg. body, paragraphs, headings and rest of eerything else gets a class

Compound selectors and specificity
